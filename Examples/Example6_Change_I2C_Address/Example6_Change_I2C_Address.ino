/*
  This example code demonstrates how to change the address of the Single or
  Quad Qwiic Relay to one of your choosing. There is a set range of available
  addresses from 0x07 to 0x78, so make sure your chosen address falls within
  this range. The next thing to note is that when you change the address you'll
  need to call an instance of the Qwiic_Relay class that includes your new
  address: "Qwiic_Relay relay(YOUR_NEW_ADDRESS_HERE);" so that the new address
  is fed to all the available functions. Finally if for some reason you've
  forgotten your new address. No big deal, load up the I2C scanner example code
  and find out where your product's address is at.
